The Department of Human Geography of the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University (TSU) and the Department of Geography of the University of Zurich (GIUZ) plan to establish a joint course on sustainable development in mountain areas. 
Rural development in different mountain areas often faces similar challenges, for example due to structural disadvantages or climate change. The national strategy for Georgian rural development (2017-2020) adjusted to these challenges by changing the general policy orientation from an agricultural to a rural development policy (see Hodge & Midmore, 2008). The strategy promotes a diversification of the rural economy, local community development and participation to tackle poverty and inequality, and nature protection. Whereas the rural development policy evolved and its implementation is supported by various development projects, there is a significant lack of academic knowledge, research, and education in this topic area.
