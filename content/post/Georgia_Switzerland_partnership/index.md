In 2020, academic staff from the [Department of Geography at the University of Zurich](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/sns.html) and the [Department of Human Geography at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Universityâ€™s Faculty of Social and Political Sciences](https://www.tsu.ge/en) teamed up to create a new, modular course at both institutions.

The project received financial assistance in the form of a seed funding grant from the [Swiss Leading House for Science and Technology Cooperation, University of Geneva](https://unige-leadinghouse.ch/?fbclid=IwAR11tjpSn3I_Xy3MkydPSAZ1zwPsGYPypfUrQXPPY1bj2QLHxIT-WTmlYO0), as part of the [Swiss Bilateral Cooperation Programme of SERI](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-cooperation-r-and-i/bilateral-programmes.html). The course provides a unique setting to engage with various socio-political contexts in the Caucasus and Central Europe, stimulating critical engagement with and reflection on processes linked to sustainable development in mountain areas.

The first cohort of students from both universities will enter the course in fall 2022. Lectures and seminar sessions will be simultaneously held online and in-person in Zurich and Tbilisi, addressing students on advanced bachelor and master levels, respectively. The course will include traditional and innovative lecture formats, based on student-centered teaching and participatory learning to foster student engagement, as well as the in-depth exploration of course topics and research methods.

The project team would like to express gratitude towards the [Swiss Leading House for Science and Technology Cooperation, University of Geneva](https://unige-leadinghouse.ch/?fbclid=IwAR11tjpSn3I_Xy3MkydPSAZ1zwPsGYPypfUrQXPPY1bj2QLHxIT-WTmlYO0), for their financial assistance, without which the creation of the study course would be impossible. Furthermore, special thanks for the considerable in-kind support by the [Swiss Embassy in Georgia](https://www.eda.admin.ch/tbilisi) â€” particularly its former Deputy head, Mr Alvaro Borghiâ€”for institutional support and personal encouragement.
