Currently, I am a PhD Candidate at Tbilisi State University, Department of Sociology. My academic career already includes several impactful research projects focusing on people’s livelihoods in rural and mountain settlements.

After accumulating research experiences in interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, participatory, action and transformative studies, I am in favor of these approaches which prevent staying the research results on the dusty shells or databases.

I believe that the researcher’s primary role is to explore hitherto hidden and spread it in an understandable way to the relevant stakeholders. For this reason, I synthesise in practice social science theories, methods and information handling tools, such as R/Rstudio, QGIS, SPSS, Excel, Access, MAXQDA, Mendeley, etc.
