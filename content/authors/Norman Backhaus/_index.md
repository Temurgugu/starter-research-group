I am a professor for Human Geography at the Department of Geography of the University of Zurich. I currently teach and do research on globalisation, nature conservation and landscape. I am mainly interested in perceptions of changes by different interest groups. With my and my groupâ€™s research I want to contribute to sustainable development. Regionally I did and do research in Southeast Asia and in Switzerland. Moreover, I supervise research in Central and North Asia. I am a member of the Swiss Federal National Park commission and co-director of the University Priority Programme Global Change and Biodiversity.
